# DraggableTest

Implementation of draggable elements in Phoenix LiveView. Based on [this](https://www.headway.io/blog/client-side-drag-and-drop-with-phoenix-liveview) blog post.

## How to run

To start your Phoenix server:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
